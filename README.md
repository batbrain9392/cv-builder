AI-powered CV and cover letter builder that runs entirely in your browser.

✍️ Writing a CV is hard. 🎯 Tailoring it for every job you apply to is even harder. This app lets you load your full career history once, paste a job description, let AI reshape your experience highlights and summary to match, then tweak the result before you export. 📋 The Word (DOCX) output uses clean, structured formatting designed to be parsed correctly by most applicant tracking systems (ATS).

📲 Installable as a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps) — works offline on phone or desktop, no app store needed. Core editing and export work without a connection; AI features require internet.

## ✨ Features

- ✏️ Build and edit a CV with a **live side-by-side preview**
- 🤖 **AI-powered generation** of professional summary, cover letter, and experience highlights using Google Gemini
- 📄 Export to **DOCX** or **JSON** — import from JSON to pick up where you left off
- 📝 **Markdown** support in text fields for rich formatting
- 📲 Installable **Progressive Web App** with service worker caching

## 🧑‍💻 Using the AI features (optional)

The core CV builder works perfectly without AI — you can build, preview, and export without ever enabling it. AI tailoring is an **opt-in** feature that uses Google Gemini to rewrite your content to match a specific job description. You bring your own API key (free tier, no billing required).

1. 👤 Fill in all your details — personal info, experience, education, skills — or **import a JSON** you exported earlier
2. 📋 Paste a **job description** into the Job Description section and add your free [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
3. 🤖 Hit **Enhance with AI** to tailor your experience highlights, summary, and cover letter to the job, then tweak anything that still feels off
4. 💾 Hit **Save** to store your progress in the browser, or export as DOCX for submission / JSON for a portable backup
5. 📄 Need a PDF? Open the DOCX in Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice and print to PDF

## 🔒 Privacy

- 🍪 **No cookies.** None.
- 🚫 **No backend server.** Gemini API calls go directly from your browser to Google using your own API key.
- 💾 **`localStorage`** is used to save your CV data, Gemini API key, and theme preference in your browser so you can pick up where you left off. Nothing is sent to any server.
- 🔑 Your Gemini API key is stored locally on your device — never on a server. Anyone with access to this browser can read it, so use a device you trust.
- 📤 You can also export your data as JSON or DOCX at any time. Use **Clear all** in the editor to wipe both the form and local storage.

## 🛠️ Built with

🖥️ Code written in **[Cursor](https://cursor.com)** with **[Claude Opus](https://anthropic.com/claude)** by Anthropic. ✨ Live AI features inside the app are powered by **[Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)** (gemini-2.5-flash).

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployed automatically to **GitHub Pages** on every push to `main` via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/deploy.yml). The app is served under a `/cv-builder/` subpath and uses `HashRouter` for client-side routing, so in-app URLs look like `/#/app`.

To enable on a fresh fork: go to **Settings > Pages** and set the source to **GitHub Actions**.
